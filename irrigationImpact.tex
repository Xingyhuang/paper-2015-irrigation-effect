\begin{abstract}

This study applies the recently developed variable-resolution capability within the Community Earth System Model (VR-CESM) to understand the impact of irrigation on the regional climate of California. Irrigation is an important contributor to the regional climate of heavily irrigated regions, and within the U.S. there are few regions that are as heavily irrigated as California's Central Valley, responsible for 25$\%$ of domestic agricultural products. This study uses a flexible irrigation scheme with relatively realistic estimates of regional agricultural water use. The impact of irrigation on mean climatology and heat extremes is investigated over the 26 year period 1980-2005 using a relatively fine grid resolution of $0.25^\circ$ ($\sim$28 km). Three simulations are performed, including an unirrigated control run and two irrigation-enabled runs, with results compared to gridded observations and weather station datasets. During the summer months (when irrigation peaks), the cooling effect caused by irrigation is apparent in the daily maximum near-surface temperature field (Tmax) with a magnitude of around 1.1 K (seasonally averaged). Compared with the control run, latent heat flux increased by $\sim$61$\%$ during the daytime as a result of increased evaporation from the surface. Specific humidity also increased by about 12$\%$, heat stress was reduced by 22$\%$ and the average soil moisture showed a statistically significant increase ($\sim$5$\%$) under irrigation. Compared with observations, irrigation improved the frequency distribution of Tmax, and both length and frequency of hot spells were better captured with irrigation enabled. Consequently, we argue that high-resolution simulations of regional climate in CESM, particularly over heavily irrigated regions, should likely enable the irrigation parameterization to better represent local temperature statistics.

%As we found, irrigation in the Central Valley (CV) is an important component of the region's surface energy budget that must be parameterized in climate models in order to properly simulate temperature statistics.

%Tmin is scarcely affected by irrigation, and no notable difference is observed when reducing the irrigated water by half, which may due to that irrigated water does not effectively infiltrate into lower soil layers when reaching certain level. 
%This study adds the value of variable-resolution global climate models (VRGCMs) in capturing fine-scale land-air interactions for long-term climate and can motivate more realistic climate adaptation strategies.

\section{Introduction}

{\color{red}Some text uses 1980-2005, some text uses 1981-2005 -- please unify.  Also change references of ``26 years'' to ``25 years'' if appropriate.}

Over the past century, human activity has had a clear impact on global and regional climate, largely through indirect effects associated with increasing greenhouse gases \citep{solomon2007ipcc}, but also as a result of land cover changes, particularly deforestation, agriculture and urbanization \citep{bonan1997effects, pielke2002influence, kueppers2008seasonal}. Conversion of the natural land surface to cropland features prominently in this change, which is accompanied by modified albedo and differences in both sensible and latent heat fluxes \citep{foley2003green}. Besides affecting energy balance, land management also impacts the climate system by modifying the carbon and water cycles, which are driven in part by cropping length and irrigation strategy \citep{lobell2006biogeophysical}. The pronounced cooling effect of irrigation, especially over regions where irrigation is extensive, has been emphasized by previous studies \citep{kueppers2007irrigation, lobell2008effect}.  

%In some areas with extensive irrigation, the cooling effect by irrigation can match or even exceed the impacts of greenhouse warming [Diffenbaugh, 2009; Kueppers et al., 2007; Lobell et al., 2008; Puma and Cook, 2010].
%The effect of irrigation on climate seems to be much more prominent than the land surface change (govindasamy2001land, bounoua2002effects, matthews2004natural). 

California is the most irrigated state in the U.S., and most of California's irrigated cropland is distributed over the Central Valley (CV), which is responsible for 25$\%$ of domestic agricultural products \citep{wilkinson2002preparing}. The CV extends 600 km between its northernmost and southernmost point and is between 60-100km in width.  It features a vast agricultural industry that has adapted to an extremely dry growing season and Mediterranean climate through the adoption of extensive irrigation practices. The USGS reported that in the year 2000, approximately 42 km$^3$ of water was used over $\sim$41,000 km$^2$ of irrigated area within California \citep{doll2002global, famiglietti2011satellites}. \cite{bonfils2007empirical} found that irrigation over CV has decreased summertime maximum temperature by $\sim$2-3 K in heavily-irrigated areas compared with nearby non-irrigated areas, based on long-term temperature records, although these impacts had a negligible effect on nighttime temperatures. Similar impacts have also been demonstrated in Nebraska's irrigated areas by \citet{mahmood2006impacts}.

%More than half of this area (CV) has been converted to agriculture since the presettlement period. The Central Valley produces one quarter of the agricultural products in the United States, with an annual income exceeding $26 billion and an export revenue exceeding $6.7 billion (wilkinson2002preparing). Thus, understanding the climate variability in this area is critical for projecting future economic sustainability in California and the USA. It accounts for one sixth of the country's irrigated land [Faunt, 2009].

%bonfils2007empirical found that irrigation expansion has had a large cooling effect on summertime average daily daytime temperatures (0.14¡C to 0.25¡C per decade), which corresponds to an estimated cooling of 1.8¡C to 3.2¡C since the introduction of irrigation practices. Irrigation has negligible effects on nighttime temperatures, leading to a net cooling effect of irrigation on climate (0.06¡C to 0.19¡C per decade). Stabilization of irrigated area has occurred in California since 1980 and is expected in the near future for many irrigated regions. 

%mahmood2006impacts found an irrigation-induced cooling of *1 K in maximum growing season temperatures in irrigated areas in Nebraska.

However, irrigation effects are usually ignored in climate models for several reasons: irrigation usually occurs over a relatively small area ($\sim$2$\%$ of global land surface) and produces a seemingly negligible cooling effect compared to global greenhouse warming \citep{boucher2004direct}. Nonetheless, with the increasing need for more accurate regional climate studies for formulating climate adaptation and mitigation strategies, irrigation is a potentially important factor in regulating regional climate patterns. Studies have typically addressed the climatic effects of irrigation in limited-area models (LAMs) \citep{snyder2006regional, kueppers2007irrigation}, which in the context of climate modeling are typically referred to as regional climate models (RCMs). In these studies, irrigation was modeled by accounting for the amount of irrigated water needed and the area of cropland where irrigation is applied. Using a multi-model ensemble of RCM simulations, \cite{kueppers2008seasonal} found that the behavior of RCMs varied in representing effects of irrigation on regional climate, depending on each model's physics, as well as on irrigation configurations.

%\cite{kueppers2007irrigation}, using RegCM3 (the third generation of the Regional Climate Model), simulated the effect of irrigation on regional climate in the CV by forcing the RegCM3 root zone (top 1 m) soil moisture to field capacity at every time step during the simulation period. They found that, as a result of this change, irrigated areas has been cooled by $\sim$3.7 K in August. {\color{red}Therefore, the magnitude of the irrigation cooling effect is not only related with the specific land surface model but also controlled by the way irrigation works. [If you only present one study you can't claim that the impact of irrigation is related to the choice of land surface model and irrigation scheme]}

%Recently, climate research groups in California have conducted a model intercomparison study of the climate response to land-use change in the western United States (Kueppers et al. 2008; hereafter referred to as K08). All of the models showed large decreases in August mean and maximum 2-m air temperatures where irrigation replaced natural vegetation. Kueppers et al. [2008] compared the effects of irrigation on regional climate, with specific emphasis on summer temperatures. Based on simulations by the different Regional ClimateModels (RCMs), they found that the behavior of RCMs varied, depending on each model's physics, as well as on irrigation configurations.

%Kueppers et al. (2007) investigated the irrigation cooling effect over California by holding root zone soil moisture fixed at field capacity year-round in irrigated grid cells.

%For example, \citet{adegoke2003impact} found reduced near-surface temperature over irrigated land in Nebraska, with the fraction of irrigation grid cells is set up to be saturated at 0000 UTC each day.  

Although global climate models (GCMs) rarely account for irrigation, it is nonetheless meaningful to understand to what extent irrigation may affect the global climate patterns \citep{sacks2009effects}. \citet{lobell2006biogeophysical} coupled the community atmosphere model (CAM) 3.0 to the community land model (CLM) 3.0 at $\sim$2-2.5$^\circ$ horizontal grid spacing to model irrigation by fixing soil moisture at saturation during the growing season in all croplands. Although this approach likely overcompensated for total added water, it was found that global irrigation led to a global land surface cooling of 1.3 K, and regional cooling of up to 8 K. \citet{lo2013irrigation} used CAM 3.5 along with CLM 3.5 at $\sim$1.4$^\circ$ horizontal resolution, and showed that the increase in evapotranspiration and water vapor due to irrigation significantly impacts the atmospheric circulation in the southwestern United States by strengthening the regional hydrological cycle. 

%{\color{red} whether add this? "\citet{sacks2009effects} also used the CAM 3.0 coupled to the CLM 3.5 and compared global simulations at 2.8$^\circ$ with and without irrigation, and found that the cooling effect of irrigation seemed to be dominated by indirect effects like an increase in cloud cover."}

%\citet{sacks2009effects} also used the CAM (add version here) coupled to the CLM (add version here) and compared global simulations with and without irrigation, and found that irrigation alters climate significantly in some regions with cooling effect of near surface temperature for about 0.5 K averaged over the year. $\sim$2.8$^\circ$ for sacks2009effects

%%%%%%%%%%
%Kueppers et al. (2007) investigated the irrigation cooling effect over California. They found that the conversion of natural vegetation to irrigated crops has cooled irrigated areas by *3.7 K in August and *1.6 K year round. Averaged over all of California, they found that irrigation (along with other land cover changes) has decreased August temperatures by *0.4 K. Kueppers et al. (2007), in contrast, performed their irrigation by holding root zone soil moisture fixed at field capacity year-round in irrigated grid cells. They did not report how much water they added through irrigation, an omission common to many irrigation modeling studies. Using RegCM3, Kueppers et al. [2007] simulated the effect of irrigation on regional climate in the Central Valley, California, at interannual scales of irrigation, they forced the RegCM3 root zone (top 1 m) soil moisture to field capacity at every time step during the simulation period. (30km)

%"Many studies have quantitatively investigated the impact of irrigation on weather, climate, and hydrology at different scales. Such studies have relied mainly on the use of physics-based numerical models"


The aforementioned studies that addressed the impact of irrigation either used RCMs or coarse-resolution GCMs, along with different irrigation schemes. In order to model regional climate over the CV, relatively fine horizontal resolution is needed to more accurately represent microclimates, land-use, small-scale dynamical features and interactions \citep{leung2003regional, rauscher2010resolution}. In this paper, we use the recently developed variable-resolution option in Community Earth System Model (VR-CESM) to study the impact of irrigation on regional climate over the CV, with a more flexible irrigation scheme with relatively realistic estimates of regional agricultural water use (as will be described in Section 2). Variable-resolution GCMs (VRGCMs) such as VR-CESM use a relatively coarse global model with enhanced resolution over a specific region \citep{staniforth1978variable, fox1997finite}. 


Compared with RCMs, a key advantage of VRGCMs is that they use a single, unified modeling framework, rather than a separate GCM and RCM with potentially inconsistent dynamics and physics parameterizations and lack of two-way interactions at the nest boundary \citep{laprise2008challenging}. Compared to uniform-resolution global models, VRGCMs provide a cost-effective approach for reaching high resolutions over a region of interest -- the regional simulations in this study at $\sim$28 km resolution represent a reduction in required computation of approximately 10 times over a global uniform resolution 0.25$^\circ$ simulation. VR-CESM has been demonstrated to be effective for regional climate studies and applications at a reduced computational cost compared to uniform GCMs \citep{zarzycki2015effects, rhoades2015characterizing, huang2016evaluation}. In particular, this study is one of the first to use variable resolution for assessing the impact of a physical parameterization at high-resolution in a global Earth-system model. The central hypothesis of this paper is that irrigation in the Central Valley (CV) of California is an important contributor to the region's surface energy budget and must be accounted for in order to properly simulate temperature statistics. This hypothesis is tested by comparing the temperature statistics of control (non-irrigated) and irrigated 26-year simulations in VR-CESM.

%{\color{red}What about Huang et al. 2015} I will add this later



%Further, to properly account for interactions and teleconnections between scales, future projections of climate change should be simulated with global modeling systems.  

%\citet{sorooshian2011significant} applied a RCM with rather fine-resolution at 4km for irrigation over CV for less than 5 years.

%LAMs may suffer from potential inconsistencies between the global and regional scales and lack two-way interactions at the nest boundary \citep{warner1997tutorial, mcdonald2003transparent, laprise2008challenging, mesinger2013limited}, problems that can be mitigated with the use of VRGCMs. 
%\citet{zarzycki2015effects} applied VR-CESM at 0.25$^\circ$  and fount that xx. \citet{Huang2015 studied and found that} \citet{Rhoades2015Characterizing} has also assessed the use of VR-CESM for modeling mountain snowpack in the western United States and found that.

This study builds on a number of previous modeling studies that have explored the importance of irrigation in controlling the climate of the CV region in the following ways: (1) it employs relatively high resolution (0.25$^\circ$) over the CV region over long-term period  (from year 1980-01-01 to 2005-12-31); (2) it uses a more realistic irrigation parameterization embedded in CLM 4.0 coupled in CESM 1.2.0 rather than experimentally fixed irrigated water as in many previous studies (\textit{i.e.} \cite{lobell2006biogeophysical, lo2013irrigation}); (3) it uses a variable-resolution global climate model (rather than the low-resolution global or limited area models forced by reanalysis dataset or GCM output that have been previously used); and (4) it explores the effect of irrigation on the regional climate, focusing on temperature statistics, including extreme heat, which is rarely touched on by previous studies.  We conclude that the irrigation parameterization in CESM is effective at addressing a bias in daily maximum temperatures and heatwave statistics in California's CV, and is necessary in order to capture temperature statistics in irrigated regions at high model resolution.

This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the model setup, employed datasets and methodology. In section 3, simulation results are provided and analyzed. Key results are summarized along with further discussion in section 4.

\section{Model setup and reference datasets}

\subsection{Irrigation scheme}

As a state-of-the-art Earth modeling framework, CESM 1.2.0 consists of coupled atmospheric, oceanic, land and sea ice models \citep{neale2010description, hurrell2013community}. In this study, CAM version 5 (CAM5) \citep{CAM5Tech} and CLM version 4.0 \citep{CLM40Tech} are used.  Global sea-surface temperatures are prescribed in accordance with the AMIP protocol.  The finest horizontal resolution of our grid is 0.25$^\circ$ ($\sim$ 28km) covering the western U.S., with a quasi-uniform 1$^\circ$ mesh over the remainder of the globe (See Figure \ref{fig:Figure 1}). Considering the relatively flat topography (less than 100m) over most of CV, the $\sim$28km grid resolution satisfies our need for modeling irrigation effects; in particular, simulations at 0.125$^\circ$ ($\sim$14km) conducted in \cite{huang2016evaluation} did not show a statistically significant change in temperature statistics over California. A detailed description of the version of VR-CESM employed in this paper can be found in \cite{rhoades2015characterizing}. Here, our model description focuses on the irrigation scheme within CLM 4.0.

The fractional area data of the cropland within each grid cell (independent of specific type) that is equipped for irrigation is from \citet{siebert2005development} for the year 2000, and is fixed over the simulation period (see Figure \ref{fig:Figure 2}). This assumption is reasonable since irrigated area has been largely unchanged in California since year 1980 \citep{bonfils2007empirical}. 

%The basic idea of the irrigation model is described as follows, with some differences from what described and applied in \cite{sacks2009effects}.

The need for daily irrigation is determined at 6 AM local time by computing the deficit between the current soil moisture content and a target soil moisture content. If positive, the difference is then added to the ground surface at a constant rate over the following four hours, bypassing canopy interception. By default, CLM simulates ten soil layers, with a total depth of 3.4 m \citep{CLM40Tech}. The target soil moisture content in each soil layer $i$ ($w_{target, i}$, in kg/m$^2$) is a weighted average of (a) the minimum soil moisture content that results in no water stress (w$_{o,i}$, kg/m$^2$) and (b) the soil moisture content at saturation ($w_{sat,i}$, kg/m$^2$) \citep{CLM40Tech}, in accordance with

\begin{align} \label{eq:TargetSoilMoisture}
w_{target,i} = (1-{\alpha})*w_{o,i} + {\alpha}*w_{sat,i}.
\end{align} The default value of the irrigation weight factor $\alpha$ is 0.7, which was determined empirically to give global, annual irrigation amounts that approximately match observed gross irrigation water use around the year 2000 \citep{shiklomanov2000appraisal}. This parameterization is designed to approximate human behavior -- that is, enough water is added so as to avoid water stress in crops, but not so much that the soil is completely saturated. More details about the irrigation model can be found in the online technical description \citep{irrigationTechnicCLM}.

%Siebert et al. [2005] provided a GlobalMap of Irrigated Area (GMIA) representing the fraction of area equipped for irrigation around the year of 2000 with a spatial resolution of 5 arc minutes (hereafter denoted as FGMIA). They combined input data sets from various sources such as The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations reports, the United Nations, Ministries of Agriculture and land use, and land cover data set from United States Geological Survey (USGS) for the year 2000. This map has been widely used in modeling [Sacks et al., 2009; Saeed et al., 2009] and observational studies [Bonfils and Lobell, 2007; Zhu et al., 2012] and has become the defacto information source for spatial distribution of global irrigated areas of the present day.

%Sack2009 "combine the most realistic aspects of Boucher et al. 2004 and lobell2006biogeophysical. To do this, we use a global irrigation map based on census data from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (Helkowski 2004; Foley et al. 2005). We add the irrigation water directly to the land surface and allow the land model to determine the fraction evaporated or transpired. Thus, we use a sophisticated land surface model that calculates the partitioning between evapotranspiration and runoff, and an observation-based data set of the locations and amounts of irrigation."

%On the other hand, Lobell et al. [2009], using the Community Atmospheric Model (CAM3.3) and through prescribing the top 30 cm soil moisture at the irrigation grid for 90%, 50%, 40%, and 30%of soil saturation, found that the impacts of irrigation on air temperature and latent heat fluxes are Òextremely insensitiveÓ to soil moisture increases beyond 30% saturation. The results from Lobell et al. [2009] may be relevant to the land surface model, i.e., the Community Land Model (CLM) they used.
%The same results were done by Kueppers and Snyder [2011], who also claimed that Òirrigation to 50, 75, or 100% of field capacity did not result in detectably different effects on afternoon maximum temperatures in any month of the year in RegCM3,Ó which is coupled with BATS LSM.

%\subsection{VR-CESM}

%CESM is a state-of-the-art Earth modeling framework managed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), consisting of coupled atmospheric, oceanic, land and sea ice models. CESM has been frequently used for modeling present and future global climate \citep{neale2010description, hurrell2013community}. The coupling infrastructure in CESM communicates the interfacial states and fluxes between each component model so that fluxes are conserved. Since we follow the Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP) protocols \citep{Gates1992}, only the atmosphere and land model are integrated dynamically. Here, CAM version 5 (CAM5) \citep{CAM5Tech} and the Community Land Model (CLM) version 4 \citep{CLM40Tech} are used. The SE dynamical core, which possesses attractive conservation and parallel scaling properties \citep{dennis2011cam, taylor2011conservation}, is employed along with variable-resolution grid support. The FAMIPC5 (F$\_$AMIP$\_$CAM5) compset was chosen for these simulations.

%For our study, the variable-resolution cubed-sphere grids are generated for use in CAM and CLM with the open-source software package SQuadGen \citep{ullrich2014squadgen}. The grids used are depicted in Figure \ref{fig:VR-CESM_map}. The maximum horizontal resolution on these grids is 0.25 $^\circ$ ($\sim$ 28km), with a quasi-uniform 1 $^\circ$ mesh over the remainder of the globe. In our study and in previous studies (e.g. \citet{zarzycki2015effects}), general circulation patterns (e.g. wind, pressure and precipitation) do not exhibit apparent artifacts in the variable-resolution transition region, and the design of the SE dynamical core ensures that dry air and tracer mass are conserved globally \citep{taylor2010compatible}. Simulations were performed over the time period from 1979-01-01 to 2005-12-31 (UTC) and 1979 is discarded as a spin-up period. This time period was chosen to provide an adequate sampling of annual variability, and to limit computational cost.

%Variable-resolution topography files were produced by sampling the National Geophysical Data Center (NGDC) 2-min ($\sim$ 4 km) Gridded Global Relief Dataset (ETOPO2v2) topography dataset, followed by application of a differential smoothing technique as described in \citet{zarzycki2015effects}.  

%Land surface datasets, including plant functional types, were created using the $0.5$ $^\circ$ reference datasets. Greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and aerosol forcing are prescribed based on historical observations. CAM and CLM tuning parameters are not modified from their default configurations. SSTs and ice coverage are supplied by the 1 $^\circ$ Hadley Centre Sea Ice and Sea Surface Temperature dataset (HadISST) \citep{hurrell2008new}. 

\subsection{Simulations}

In order to understand the impacts on the local climate triggered by irrigation of the CV, we have conducted a control run (NRG) without irrigation and two irrigation-enabled runs, referred to as IRG and IRG(0.5) respectively. The IRG run uses the default irrigation weight factor ($\alpha = 0.7$).  This value was adjusted to 0.5 in the IRG(0.5) run so as to determine the impact of changes in total irrigated water. Both simulations were performed over the period 1979-01-02 to 2005-12-31 (UTC).  For purposes of analysis, 1979 was discarded as a spin-up period to allow adequate time for the land and atmosphere to equilibrate. The 26-year time period was chosen to provide an adequate sampling of annual variability within computational constraints. A land cover dataset at 3 min ($\sim$10 km) grid resolution for year 2000 was used and it provided a realistic fraction of irrigated cropland in each grid cell over the CV when interpolating into the 28km grid (see Figure 2). 


%(Explain why 0.25 degree is enough to capture the pattern of mean climatology, e.g. topo) 


%For the NRG run, we used a 0.5$^\circ$ resolution land cover dataset, fixed at year 2000, which is consistent with the year of the observed irrigated water dataset referenced by the irrigation model.  After this simulation was completed, a finer land cover dataset at 3 min ($\sim$10 km) for year 2000 was obtained {\color{red} [from NCAR, how to cite this]} that provided a more realistic fraction of irrigated cropland in each grid cell over the CV when interpolating into the 28km grid.  After mapping to the variable-resolution model grid, the only other significant difference from the 3 min land surface dataset was 10-20$\%$ more grassland for the 0.5$^\circ$ land cover data in our study region, which we determined did not impact the local climatology.  Consequently, the higher resolution dataset was employed for both IRG simulations.

%After interpolated to our grid resolutions, there are rarely organizable differences between these two land cover datasets (the only notable pattern is (10-20$\%$) more c3 non-arctic grass, less c3 crop in some parts of CV).

\section{Methodology}

In the CV, irrigation peaks during the summer growing season \citep{salas2006estimating} in response to California's dry Mediterranean summers (with a precipitation rate of about 0.13 mm/day averaged over year 1980-2005). Our simulations accurately reproduce this observation, as most irrigated water is added during summer (see Figure 1 in the supplement document). To study the  climatological impacts of irrigation, we focus primarily on changes in June, July and August (JJA) near-surface temperatures, and the associated mechanisms driving this change. The variables of interest for this study are daily maximum, minimum and average 2 m temperatures (Tmax, Tmin and Tavg).

%These variables are key in a baseline climate assessment due to their close relationship with water resources, agriculture and health. 
%"Irrigation practice in California peaks in summer and is significant in spring but is rather sparse during the fall and winter seasons \citep{salas2006estimating}."
%(no Detrend since the trend is too small) 

To determine how irrigation affects heat extremes within the CV, we calculated hot spell length, hot spell frequency, and mean Tmax over the hot spells. For our purposes, a hot spell is defined as at least five consecutive days when Tmax exceeds 38$^\circ$C.  This threshold value approximately corresponds to the 90th percentile of the daily JJA Tmax over the 1980-2005 period within the CV. \textit{Hot spell length} is defined as the average duration (in days) for all  hot spells over the 26 year period, \textit{hot spell frequency} is defined as the average number of hot spells per year, and \textit{mean hot spell Tmax} is defined as the average Tmax over all the hot spell days. When analyzing hot spells, declustering is employed following the strategy of \cite{ferro2003inference} to ensure hot spells are serially independent.  This functionality is implemented in the R package \texttt{extRemes} \citep{gilleland2011new}.

%Simulation results were not detrended since the linear trend was small ($\sim$0.06 $^\circ$C/year) detrend or not detrend does not matter for this study. 

To restrict the analysis to the CV, the variables of interest have been masked and/or averaged within the area defined by the bounded region as sketchily depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 2}, which contains 155 grid points. To quantify the model performance in comparison with the reference datasets, the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and mean signed difference (MSD) are used, and spatial correlation (Corr) is assessed by computing sample linear cross-correlations at lag 0 after converting a two-dimensional dataset to a one-dimensional array. Mathematically, RMSD and MSD are written as, 

\begin{align}
RMSD &= \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (v_i - \hat{v}_i)^2}  & MSD &= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (v_i - \hat{v}_i) 
\end{align} where $v_i$ and $\hat{v}_i$ are values from the simulation output and reference dataset respectively; $i$ is the grid-point index and N is the total number of grid points over specific regions.

Throughout the remainder of this paper, Student's t-test has been used to test whether two sets of 26 seasonal averaged data at each grid point or spatially averaged over CV are the same, evaluated at the $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level. The t-test is used here when the sample population can be adequately described by a normal distribution, where normality is assessed under the Anderson-Darling test.

\subsection{Reference datasets}

For comparison, we employ two high-quality gridded observational datasets (UW and PRISM) and selected weather station data (NCDC) to evaluate our simulation output. The detailed descriptions of these reference datasets are as follows.

%Differences between gridded observations can be due to choice of meteorological stations, interpolation techniques, elevation models and processing algorithms. Consequently, the use of multiple reference datasets is necessary to understand the underlying uncertainty in the observational data. Detailed descriptions of these datasets are as follows.

\paragraph{UW} The UW daily gridded meteorological data is obtained from the Surface Water Modeling group at the University of Washington \citep{maurer2002long, hamlet2005production}. The dataset is provided at 0.125$^\circ$ horizontal resolution covering the period from year 1949 to 2010 with daily time frequency for Tmax and Tmin in the aspect of temperature, which are used in this study.

%UW uses a simple 6.1 K/km lapse rate for topographic effect. 
%With a good station coverage over California [including both the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (HCN) and Cooperative network observations (COOP)], a high 1/8¡  1/8¡ resolution and adjustment for urbanization effects, the UW data set (38) represents our best candidate to study the contribution of irrigation to temperature variations in California.

%\paragraph{Daymet} Daymet is an extremely high resolution (1 km) gridded dataset with daily outputs of total precipitation, humidity, and minimum/maximum temperature covering the years of 1980 through 2013 \citep{thornton1997generating, thornton2014daymet}. The dataset is produced using an algorithmic technique that ingests point station measurements in conjunction with a truncated Gaussian weighting filter.  Some adjustments are made to account for topography. Daymet is available through the Oak Ridge National Laboratory Distributed Active Archive Center (ORNL DAAC). 

%For applications of the radiation and humidity data please cite thornton1999improved, thornton2000simultaneous

\paragraph{PRISM} The Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) \citep{daly2008physiographically} gridded dataset at 4 km resolution is also employed in this study.  This model ingests point measurements and applies a weighted regression scheme that accounts for key factors affecting the local climatology. PRISM is the United States Department of Agriculture's official climatological dataset. Monthly climatological variables are available for year 1895 through 2015 and daily data for year 1981 to 2015 from the PRISM Climate Group \citep{prismSource}. This study makes use of monthly Tmax, Tmin, Tavg, and daily Tmax.

%The datasets include total precipitation and minimum/maximum, (derived) mean temperatures and dewpoints. 

\paragraph{NCDC} Weather station measurements over the CV are obtained from the Global Historical Climate Network (GHCN) and provided by NOAA/NCDC \citep{menne2012overview}. Weather stations within the study region were chosen from all stations with at least 90$\%$ observations of Tmax over all JJA days from 1981 to 2005. To make the location distribution as even as possible, eventually, 11 weather stations were employed for recorded daily Tmax.

%{\color{red} An even distribution of weather stations within the study region was chosen from all stations with at least 90$\%$ observations of Tmax and Tmin over all JJA days from 1980 to 2005.  Consequently, approximately 20 weather stations were employed for recorded Tmax and Tmin.}

%lobell2008effect "Daily Tmin and Tmax data for 1934Ð2002 were obtained for all 50 California stations in the U.S. Historical Climatology Network (USHCN; Williams et al. 2004). USHCN stations are selected based on criteria such as minimal changes in measurement time and heat island effects over time, and the daily data used in this study have not been adjusted for these or any other effects. The vast majority of irrigated area in California occurs below 40¡N and at relatively low elevations. For this study, therefore, only the 26 stations south of 40¡N and below 500-m elevation were included in the analysis, to minimize differences in latitude and elevation between sites (Fig. 2)."

\section{Results}

%\subsection{summer temperature}

The average JJA Tmin, Tavg and Tmax over the 1980-2005 time period from all simulations and gridded datasets is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 3}. Relative to the gridded datasets, NRG has a prominent overestimation of Tmax, with MSD values of $\sim$0.75 K and RMSD values of $\sim$1.7 K (see Table \ref{tab:table1}). The cooling effect caused by irrigation is clear in all temperature fields when comparing NRG and IRG results, with all fields producing significant differences (as hatched in Figure 3). Notably, no statistically significant difference in temperature arises from reducing the irrigation factor from 0.7 to 0.5. Although the IRG run shows a slight cold bias with an MSD of $\sim$ -0.36 K (which is slightly reduced in IRG(0.5) to $\sim$ -0.2 K), this effect is limited to the base of the Sierra Nevada and the San Francisco Bay Delta region.

Compared with NRG, the RMSD of Tmax for IRG(0.5) is only reduced by about 20$\%$ against PRISM, which appears to be due to the offset effects caused by the non-irrigated grid cells around our study region's boundary. Although Tmin was also reduced by about 0.5 K in IRG over the irrigated area, all three runs still exhibit a warm bias in this field relative to the reference. The net result is that Tavg is overestimated in NRG over the CV, except in regions influenced by the Delta sea breeze, whereas IRG produced a slight cool bias in Tavg after alleviating the overestimation of Tmax in the northern and southern reaches of the CV (again with a statistically significant difference from NRG). The correlation coefficients between simulations and reference datasets are about 0.76 to 0.86, indicating that VR-CESM can capture the overall spatial distributions of temperature. Though NRG and IRG are highly correlated with each other (>=0.95), this simply means that the spatial pattern of IRG is quite similar to NRG under spatially consistent cooling. Over non-irrigated areas, the results are essentially identical among all runs, suggesting that temperature modulation is largely a local phenomenon.

%Southern CV is hotter than Northern CV, Northern CV has higher soil moisture than Southern CV.

%almost the same for all three runs with a slight warm bias relative to reference datasets over irrigated area, which is not surprising as also found by \citet{lobell2006biogeophysical}. 

%{\color{red} [Tmin is significant different between NRG and IRG over part of Serra Nevada, and northern mountainous and coastal regions. And, Tmax is different over eastern region if without spatial adjustment for the p-value.]}

The differences between the IRG and IRG(0.5) simulations were quite small (no statistically significant difference), particularly when compared to the differences between IRG and NRG. Therefore, the intrinsic variability (even with some differences in irrigation water amounts) is small for VR-CESM relative to the effect of irrigation. This further testifies that the statistically significant differences between IRG and NRG are due to enabled irrigation instead of random variation. The overall performance of VR-CESM in modeling regional climate is out of the scope of this study, but has been extensively discussed in \citep{huang2016evaluation}.

%Note that UW and PRISM Tmax fields are statistically identical in the CV.

%The T-test showed that the PRISM and UW are the same over CV for JJA Tmax, but not the same for JJA Tmin. NRRIG and IRRIG are not the same over CV for JJA Tmax, Tavg, IRRIG and NRRIG are not the same as PRISM over UW for T2, especially for Tmin and Tavg, though Tmax is partly the same as UW or PRISM over CV for IRRIG.

Key variables associated with the irrigation model have been tabulated in Table \ref{tab:table2}. Tmax, latent heat flux, precipitation and specific humidity are further illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 4}. With the scarcity of natural precipitation ($\sim$0.1 mm/day), there is a $\sim$60\% increase in latent heat flux after adding $\sim$1.27 mm/day irrigated water for IRG(0.5) over the hot and dry summer period. The main contribution to latent heat flux increase from NRG to IRG is due to ground evaporation (about 2.5 times more), as vegetation evapotranspiration did not differ significantly between NRG ($\sim$1.1 mm/day) and IRG ($\sim$1.25 mm/day). Therefore, cooling of the near-surface mean and maximum temperature is largely due to increased latent heat flux during the daytime caused by evaporation from the surface. 

With irrigation enabled, the specific humidity increased by about 12$\%$ due to increased evaporation and sensible heat flux decreased by 13$\%$, with lower surface temperatures and a shift of sensible to latent heat flux. Nonetheless, the average soil moisture over all the subsurface layers only showed a slight increase ($\sim5\%$) under irrigation, although this value is still statistically significant under the t-test ($p < 0.05$).  This result suggests that irrigated water does not effectively infiltrate into lower soil layers. Although the irrigated water added in IRG(0.5) was nearly half of that of IRG, it did not lead to statistically significant differences among relevant variables, and simply led to smaller runoff (parameterized by removing surface water after infiltration into the soil) in IRG ($\sim$1.6 mm/day) compared with IRG(0.5) ($\sim$0.24 mm/day).

%Relationships among relevant variables were also investigated to determine if the land surface and irrigation models exhibited reasonable behavior. Although in IRG(0.5) irrigated water is positively correlated with soil moisture, this does not hold for IRG {\color{red}[Is this simply because IRG saturates?  In that case it's a misunderstanding of the correlation coefficient]}.  

%As expected, latent heat flux is positively correlated with soil moisture especially for IRG(0.5) and NRG. Although Tmax is positively correlated with irrigated water in IRG(0.5), it is not correlated with soil moisture or latent heat flux. {\color{red}(add correlation coefficients here} 

Based on the JJA-averaged values over 26 years, the distributions of selected variables are depicted in the box and whisker diagram in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 4}. With irrigation, both the average magnitude and annual variability of Tmax are closer to observations. Compared to NRG, the range of Tmax for irrigation runs reduced to $\sim$3$^\circ$C from $\sim$4.5$^\circ$C with a less concentrated distribution, suggesting irrigation had a modulating effect on temperature variability {\color{red}[Does an F-test show a statistically significant difference in variability?]}. Although the mean latent heat flux almost doubles for irrigation runs, the variability of the distribution did not substantially differ from NRG. {\color{red}Average precipitation did not substantially change among these three runs, however added irrigation tended to widen the range of precipitation intensity, likely due to enhanced local convective processes. NRG appears to capture the distribution of JJA precipitation better than the IRG (which shows enhanced variability), although both reference datasets (i.e. UW and PRISM) also exhibit some differences.

%Using VIC as a reference for a hydrological model, comparing with our runs with CLM4.0, VIC showed notable higher precipitation (which makes the soil moisture positively related with precipitation, but not for our runs), much lower sensible flux and similar surface run off as IRG0.5, with higher soil moisture. 

%shortwave and long wave albedo have about 0.4% difference for NGR and two IRGs, this should be due to the different use of land surface datasets. Higher albedo causes warmer for NGR to some extent. so whether we should run another 3min land surface dataset for NRG?

To further assess the ability of irrigation to modulate maximum temperature, the frequency distribution of Tmax is depicted (see Figure \ref{fig:Figure 5}) based on all JJA daily values at each CV grid point over year 1981-2005 for all runs and reference datasets including UW, PRISM and 11 weather stations (area weighted using Voronoi diagram). Overall, the NRG run exhibited an obvious warm bias associated with a long forward tail with Tmax approaching 48$^\circ$C. However, with irrigation enabled there was much closer agreement with UW and PRISM, especially in the upper tail, although a slight cold bias is apparent. Examining absolute differences, the first four moments of the frequency distribution of Tmax all showed improvement under irrigation (Table \ref{tab:table3}). Under the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, the spatially and temporally averaged JJA Tmax over the CV for the entire 26 years (compared with UW and PRISM) was significantly different from the NRG run at the 90\% level, whereas the difference was not significant for IRG or IRG(0.5).

%(i.e. 26 values for each dataset) to see if the distributions of these runs are statistically significantly different. The KS test results showed that at the significance level of 0.1, compared to gridded observations, NRG is significant different, but not for IRG.

%p-value of NRG and PRISM is 0.0885, NRG and UW is 0.04179, IRG and PRISM is 0.3071. NRG and IRG is 0.002561. see the dataset in the daily trend_multiple variables (version 1).xlsx.

%using Voronoi diagram

%The good of fit of those distributions based on KS test showed all zero p value. changing the factor to 0.1, did not change the Tmax notably, the PDF may look better with lower underestimation (but the p value of the KS test is still all zero even for upper bound (extremely small ~0) ), it seems that the clm irrig model is too sensitive to irrigated water
%Again: the KS test of the frequency distributions among three runs and UW,PRISM, are all zero (i.e. extremely small e+36), except UW and PRISM (with p-value:  0.00707, less than 0.05); when taking the values over 40, all p-value are zero.

Hot spell features related with heat extremes are tabulated in Table \ref{tab:table4} for simulations and the UW dataset (results from PRISM were effectively equivalent to UW). Although hot spells were too long and too frequent without irrigation, once irrigation was enabled, length, duration and intensity were closely matched to UW by the model (differences were not statistically significant, {\color{red}$p > 0.05$}). Notably, the cooling effect associated with irrigation led to a reduction in length and frequency of hot spells for about 20$\%$ and 30$\%$ (statistically significant, {\color{red}$p < 0.05$}). The difference in Tmax between IRG and NRG runs when averaged over hot spells, compared with the seasonal average, was approximately half (but still significant). Therefore, it appears that irrigation had less impact on the temperature of hot days, compared with average summer days (also observed by \citet{lobell2008irrigation}). 

%ad.test shows the hot spell number follows normal distribution, then using t-test: p-value between NRG, and other three is near to zero. IRG and IRG0.5 is 0.9619. IRG and UW is 0.7141; For hot spell length, the normality is week, p-value can be small as 0.002, using t-test, p-value between NRG, and other three is less than 0.01. IRG and IRG0.5 is larger than 0.05. IRG and UW is >0.05; the hot spell Tmax follows normal distribution, similar conclusions as hot spell number.

Due to the important role the CV plays in agricultural industry, we have also examined the heat stress experienced by crops. As defined by \cite{teixeira2013global}, heat stress is the number of hours per day that exceed 35$^\circ$C. In our study, heat stress was assessed for days from June 1st to September 30th (JJAS) for NRG and IRG runs. Given only daily outputs of Tmin and Tmax, this quantity was obtained using a cosine temperature fit to approximate hourly temperatures. This approach was validated by comparing the tallied number of hours exceeding 35$^\circ$ from one year of simulation with hourly output against the cosine approximation. Since the observed discrepancy was only about 4$\%$, the cosine approximation was subsequently applied to obtain hourly temperature exceedance over the 26-year study period in the CV. Based on the averaged hourly counts over the CV (depicted in Figure \ref{fig:Figure 6}), it was observed that both the heat stress intensity and frequency were reduced under irrigation. The average hours per day exceeding 35$^\circ C$ over the JJAS period was 2.352 for NRG and 1.838 for IRG -- a $\sim$22$\%$ decrease.

\section{Discussion and Summary}

With irrigation employed, nighttime warming is expected to occur, leading to an increase in daily Tmin due to the increased thermal conductivity of wet soil, as found by \cite{kanamaru2008model}, or with increased heat capacity of the soil and vegetation as argued by \cite{bonfils2007empirical}. However, as in \cite{lobell2006biogeophysical}, in our irrigation-enabled runs Tmin did not increase but decreased significantly over part of irrigated area. This study further verifies (albeit with a not-entirely independent model) the findings of previous studies that irrigation generally lowers temperatures in the CV region, with a smaller magnitude (~1.1 K) compared to what was found by \citet{bonfils2007empirical}. 

%Within the CV, CESM already has a known warm bias when compared with observations that may mitigate the warming due to irrigation \citep{huang2016evaluation}. 

%soil moisture only increased by about 5$\%$. 
% {\color{red}[As far as I know, observations show an increase in Tmin over the study period.  Do you think this is a deficiency in the irrigation model?]  

%Based on regional model simulation, \citet{kanamaru2008model} argued that "the July daily minimum temperature in the California Central Valley increased by 3.5¡C, in agreement with station observation trends over the past century in the same area.
%Christy et al. (2006) also indicated that the nighttime warming trend in the California Central Valley is likely related to irrigation. Bonfils and Lobell (2007) confirmed the daytime cooling indicated by Christy et al. (2006), but argued that their finding of nighttime warming is related to irrigation due to increased heat capacity of the soil and vegetation in the Central Valley.

\cite{lo2013irrigation} found that the irrigation in the CV results in higher precipitation rates (on the order of $\sim$15$\%$) over the southwestern U.S., along with enhanced summer monsoon rainfall. In our study, the specific humidity did show a statistically significant increase of about 12$\%$ over the irrigated area, but this did not directly lead to a statistically significant increase in average precipitation (observed to be about 18$\%$) or the low-level cloud. Notably, the moisture flux did not differ between NRG and IRG over the irrigated area and its surroundings.  There was further no evidence of an enhanced hydrological cycle with water vapor transport as argued by \cite{lo2013irrigation}. 

%However, in our study low cloud cover did increase by about 10$\%$ over the irrigated region, which corroborates with the observation of \citet{kawase2008impact} that cloud formation could increase as a result of enhanced convection. 

%However, we did not find notable increase of precipitation or cloud cover over the down-wind region

%This gives another evidence that irrigation in the Central Valley could change the regional hydrological cycle with water vapor transport, by modifying the depths of planetary boundary layer, lifting condensation level and mixing layer \citep{segal1998potential, adegoke2003impact, deangelis2010evidence, qian2013modeling}. 

%However, as \citet{kueppers2007irrigation} pointed out, the cloud cover fraction either at low or high levels did not increase over CV, though \citet{kawase2008impact} argued that cloud formation can be increased with potentially enhanced shallow and deep convections by irrigation.

%year Pr does not follow normal distribution, and wilcox.test for non-normal dataset showed pr of IRG and NRG are significantly the same (p value is 0.8206).

%{\color{red}(add the this to the increase of precipitation; the cloud over CV in SON and DJF has increased, globally the total cloud cover or low-level cloud has increased 1$\%$ to 0.1$\%$. across different seasons.)}  Statistically, cloud cover did not really bring Pr increase over SON and DJF, and Tmax over SON did not really decrease. Maybe related with downstream Pr or Cloud cover, figure out the hydrological cycle (check this if having time)

%sacks2009effects: "The cooling effect of irrigation seemed to be dominated by indirect effects like an increase in cloud cover, rather than by direct evaporative cooling. The regional effects of irrigation were as large as those seen in previous studies of land cover change, showing that changes in land management can be as important as changes in land cover in terms of their climatic effects. Our results were sensitive to the area of irrigation, but were insensitive to the details of irrigation timing and delivery."

%The irrigation effects could potentially enhance shallow and deep convections and increase cloud formation \citep{kawase2008impact; Qian et al., 2013] and precipitation [DeAngelis et al., 2010; Koster et al., 2004; Segal et al., 1998] by modifying the depths of planetary boundary layer, lifting condensation level, and mixing layer.

The irrigated water applied in the IRG simulation was $\sim$2.84 mm/day in JJA when averaged over the CV, which equates to 31.7 km$^3$ total water. In the year 2000, USGS reported that approximately 42 km$^3$ of water was used over 41,000 km$^2$ of irrigated area in California. Assuming between half to two thirds of the 42 km$^3$ of water was employed over the CV during JJA, that resolves to about 21 to 28 km$^3$, or 0.66 to 0.88 times the amount used by IRG. By decreasing the irrigation weight to 0.5, as in the IRG(0.5) simulation, total irrigated water employed has reduced by half. Nonetheless, the climatological impacts observed in IRG(0.5) were quite similar to IRG. To understand the climatological impacts under an extreme water deficit, we also performed a five year test run were the irrigation weight factor was set to zero, and added half of the water that was calculated from the deficit equation described in Section 2, resulting in irrigated water being applied at 0.42 mm/day. In this case, the average latent heat flux was around 50.65 W$/$m$^2$, which is about 80$\%$ of the value of IRG run.  This emphasizes the non-linear dependency between irrigated water application and resultant latent heat flux: specifically, most of the extra water applied in the irrigation calculation simply resulted in surface runoff rather than an enhancement of soil moisture.  Note that CLM performs relatively conservatively in soil moisture regulation. Since CLM does not simulate subsurface flow, which would be taken care of by an independent watershed model, it lacks realistic control of water infiltration configurations or ground water replenish efficiency.

%However, the irrigation scheme in CLM4.0 for our study can adjust the water deficit according to the actual soil moisture, and by assigning different irrigation weights, irrigated water can be increased or reduced accordingly, as similarly investigated by \citep{leng2013modeling}. However, in the model, intensified irrigation did not result in notable wetter soil or enhanced latent heat flux but increased surface runoff. 

%We also did five years' test run with reduced irrigation weight factor largely to 0.1, and results are still similar to the IRG run which has $\sim$3.4 times more irrigated water. 



%And the irrigated water evaporated too efficiently resulting in overcooled effect.)

%"Our results suggest that irrigation amount simulated by CLM4 can be improved by calibrating model parameter values and accurate representation of the spatial distribution and intensity of irrigated areas. \citep{leng2013modeling}"
%changing the factor to 0.0, we run the model for only 1985-08, and the QIRRIG (mm/day) in file cesm_25_irrig_rd_0.0_clm_08_1985.nc in folder HIST_VR-CESM_0.25_IRRIG_0.1 showed that the soil liquid water for NRG is still under stress, so water is added to get at least no stress. irrigated water is similar to the one with factor 0.1
%changing the factor to 0.1, did not change the Tmax notably, the PDF may look better with lower underestimation (but the p value of the KS test is still all zero even for upper bound (extremely small ~0) ), it seems that the clm irrig model is not sensitive to irrigated water

%sorooshian2011significant got that simulation results with fine model resolution and with the more realistic irrigation scheme indicate that the surface meteorological fields are noticeably improved when compared with observations from the CIMIS network and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer data. Our results also indicate that irrigation has significant impacts on local meteorological fields by decreasing temperature by 3¡Ð7¡C and increasing relative humidity by 9Ð20%, depending on model resolutions and allowable soil water depletion configurations. More significantly, our results using the improved model show that the effects of irrigation on weather and climate do not extend very far into nonirrigated regions.

%improve of the irrigation modeling: (see Sack2009)

To summarize, the variable-resolution Community Earth System Model (VR-CESM) was used to simulate the impact of irrigation on the regional climate of California's Central Valley (CV), one of the most heavily irrigated and productive areas in the U.S. Within the land component model (CLM), an irrigation scheme with relatively realistic estimates of water use was employed. The cooling effect caused by irrigation was obvious in the Tmax field with a magnitude around 1.1 K (seasonally averaged over summer months JJA), which arose from the greatly increased ($\sim$60$\%$) latent heat flux associated with daytime ground evaporation. With irrigation, both the average magnitude and annual variability of Tmax were better captured when compared with gridded observations and weather station data. Smaller differences were observed for Tmin over the irrigated area, but no statistically significant impacts from irrigation were observed over the surrounding non-irrigated area's climate. Although irrigated water did not effectively infiltrate into lower soil layers, soil moisture nonetheless exhibited a statistically significant increase (with a slight amplitude $\sim$5$\%$) under heavy irrigation. With irrigation enabled, an exceptional warm bias associated with a long forward tail of the frequency distribution of Tmax is alleviated, although a slight cold bias remained at higher elevations. Further, the cooling effect associated with irrigation led to a reduction in length and frequency of hot spells for about 20$\%$ and 30$\%$, closely matched to observations, and a decrease in the heat stress frequency of about 22$\%$ for cropland. This work suggests that the irrigation scheme should be enabled for regional climate studies with CLM and CESM, particularly over heavily irrigated regions.

In this study, we have argued that irrigation in the CV is an important component of the region's surface energy budget that must be parameterized in high-resolution global climate models in order to properly simulate temperature statistics in heavily irrigated regions. The ongoing California drought (2012-present) highlights the importance of water resources to agriculture in the CV.  In the absence of surface water for irrigation, groundwater reserves were depleted in order to maintain agricultural production.  However, it is widely acknowledged that in a prolonged future drought, continued groundwater pumping would not be sustainable, which would in turn lead to a reduction in applied irrigation water.  This study suggests that under these conditions, warming from climate change, which is tampered by irrigation in the CV, would be exacerbated and leads to a substantial increase in daily Tmax throughout the CV with repercussions for human health and heat stress. Consequently, we anticipate this study can be extended to better understanding the feedbacks associated with prolonged drought conditions in the U.S. West.

%{\color{red}[why are these new results important, and what do they mean for future research]}


%Adding irrigation tends to widen the range of precipitation intensity, opposite for soil moisture. 

%With current intense drought, over-pumping groundwater would result in more and more dry soil. And irrigation-induced cooling could be slowdown, which makes the Central Valley even more vulnerable to future greenhouse-induced warming \citep{bonfils2007empirical, williams2015contribution}.

%the benefit of irrigation cooling
%drip irrigation or flood irrigation 

%"In California, the end of irrigation expansion since 1980 is likely to persist in the future, as urban areas and water demand continue to expand (35) and irrigation water sources decline (either by overdrafting existing groundwater systems and rivers or by potential shifts in stream-flow timing or rainfall patterns). A recession in irrigation-induced cooling associated with projected future greenhouse-induced warming would result in substantial warming in the Central Valley, which could have strong, negative effects on agriculture. 
%"The suppression of past human-induced greenhouse warming by increased irrigation is therefore likely to slow in the future, and a potential decrease in irrigation may even contribute to a more rapid warming. Changes in irrigation alone are not expected to influence broad-scale temperatures, but they may introduce large uncertainties in climate projections for irrigated agricultural regions, which provide 40$\%$ of global food production. \citep{bonfils2007empirical}"  "The Central Valley may be particularly vulnerable to warming-driven drought if reductions in water supply cause reductions in irrigation, as irrigation has slowed warming in this region. \citep{williams2015contribution}" 
 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%lo2013irrigation: Whereas the first-order effect of Central Valley irrigation results in a net land surface cooling and increases atmospheric water vapor locally in California, the second-order effect of Central Valley irrigation results in higher precipitation rates over the southwestern United States, including enhancing summer monsoon rainfall and strengthening the regional water cycle.We demonstrate in a model a clear mechanism that the water vapor transport resulting from irrigation initiates atmospheric instabilities over the southwestern United States, where soil moisture feedback and lateral water vapor convergence also play an important role in increasing precipitation in the region. We also identify that irrigation in the Central Valley initiates a previously unknown, anthropogenic loop in the regional hydrological cycle, in which summer precipitation is increased by 15%, causing a corresponding increase in Colorado River streamflow of ~30%.

%kueppers2012influence: We also observed decreases of up to 1,500 m in boundary layer height at midday in summer months, and marginally significant reductions in surface zonal wind speed in July and August at 19:00 PST. 

%Weare and Du (2008) explored the influences of global warming and land use changes on past climate change in California and conclude that in summer, irrigation has a strong effect on the differences between recent and past conditions in maximum temperature, surface latent and sensible heat fluxes, surface moisture, and surface humidity.

%ad.test shows the hot spell number follows normal distribution, then using t-test: p-value between NRG, and other three is near to zero. IRG and IRG0.5 is 0.9619. IRG and UW is 0.7141; For hot spell length, the normality is week, p-value can be small as 0.002, using t-test, p-value between NRG, and other three is less than 0.01. IRG and IRG0.5 is larger than 0.05. IRG and UW is >0.05; the hot spell Tmax follows normal distribution, similar conclusions as hot spell number. 


%threshold at 38C is used
%Statistical test (wilcox.test) of non-normal dataset showed hot spell length for NRG is different from UW, IRG and IRG(0.5) are not different from UW. Statistical test (KS test) of normal dataset showed hot spell number for NRG is different from UW, IRG and IRG(0.5) are not different from UW. Statistical test (KS test) of normal dataset showed Tmax for NRG is different from UW, IRG and IRG(0.5) are not different from UW.  But anyway, these are average over each grid cell.

%ad.test shows the Tmax follows normal distribution, then using t-test: p-value between NRG, and other four is less than 0.05. IRG and IRG0.5 is not sig. different. IRG and UW,PRISM are not sig. different, so does IRG(0.5). For Pr, it is not normal, and they seem not be sig. different. For latent heat flux, they are normal, NRG is different from IRG and IRG(0.5), IRG and IRG(0.5) are not sig. dif. For soil moisture, they are normal. NRG is different from IRG and IRG(0.5), IRG and IRG(0.5) is similar, with p-value around 0.05 by ks.test.
